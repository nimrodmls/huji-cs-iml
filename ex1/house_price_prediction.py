    # Question 4 - Feature evaluation of train dataset with respect to response

    # Question 5 - preprocess the test data

    # Question 6 - Fit model over increasing percentages of the overall training data
    # For every percentage p in 10%, 11%, ..., 100%, repeat the following 10 times:
    #   1) Sample p% of the overall training data
    #   2) Fit linear model (including intercept) over sampled set
    #   3) Test fitted model over test set
    #   4) Store average and variance of loss over test set
    # Then plot average loss as function of training size with error ribbon of size (mean-2*std, mean+2*std)
